The Depths (Alternate Hell)
=========================================
0.4.0.2
This mod uses altlib to better be able to be used with other alternate mods like the Confection

The Depths is an alternate version of the underworld similar to how crimson corruption works. It generates instead of the underworld to ive some of your worlds that bit of spice when starting a new playthrough.
This mod is made by the same devs behind the confection mod, a mod similar to this one but for the hallow. This biome and most of its sprites and ideas come from Snickerbobble and her forum talking about her take on an alternate hell.

We encourage people make new worlds as this mod adds world generation to new worlds that allows the new content to be accessed.
